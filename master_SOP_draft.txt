3. **The Feature:** "Did you know you can print invoices from your phone? Here is how."
4. **The Behind-the-Scenes:** Photo of you packing an order or setting up a system.

## **4. Budget & Cash Control Workflow**

* **Who:** Single Staff Member (Execution & Logging) & Business Owner (Approval & Review).
* **When:**
* **Recording:** Immediately when an expense occurs.
* **Review:** The **1st Business Day** of every month.


* **What Information:**
* **Fixed Costs:** Date paid, Provider (e.g., Internet ISP), Amount.
* **Variable Costs:** Client Name, Type (Travel/Print), Amount.
* **Buffer Status:** Total Revenue minus Total Costs = Net Cash (Amount to transfer to Savings).


* **What Format:** "Monthly Budget Tracker" (Excel Sheet or Physical Ledger Book) with three distinct sections: **Fixed**, **Variable**, and **Reserve**.
* **How to keep log for audit:**
* **Receipts:** Photo of every physical receipt (taxi, printing shop) uploaded to an "Expenses_[Month]" folder.
* **Naming:** File names must include date and amount (e.g., `2023-10-12_Taxi_5000MMK.jpg`).


* **Who certify it:** Business Owner (Must sign off on the Monthly P&L report).
* **How to follow up:**
* **Over-Budget Alert:** If Variable Costs for a specific client exceed **10% of that client's contract value**, stop spending and notify the Owner immediately.
* **Savings Transfer:** Immediately transfer the calculate "Cash Buffer" to the separate Reserve Bank Account on the 1st of the month.



### **The Process (Expense Categories)**

#### **A. Fixed Costs (The "Keep the Lights On" Fund)**

*These must be paid first, usually on the 1st-5th of the month.*

1. **Internet/Wifi:** (e.g., Fiber Bill)
2. **Phone/Data:** (Staff SIM card top-up)
3. **Transport Allowance:** (Fixed monthly stipend if applicable)
4. **Shop Utility:** (Electricity/Water)

#### **B. Variable Costs (The "Per-Client" Costs)**

*These are costs triggered only when we serve a client. tracked against that specific Client's Revenue.*

1. **Travel:** Taxi/Bus fare for on-site demos or installation.
2. **Printing:** Contracts, invoices, and marketing brochures given to the client.
3. **Support:** Any direct costs to fix a client's issue (e.g., replacing a cable).

#### **C. Savings Target (The "Cash Buffer")**

* **Rule:** **20% of Net Profit** (Revenue - Expenses) must be saved.
* **Action:** Once the monthly reconciliation is done, transfer this amount to a separate "Emergency Fund" account. This ensures the business survives slow months.

---

### **Cost Control Checklist (Before Quoting)**

*To prevent underpricing, the Staff Member must check this before sending a custom quote.*

1. **Estimate Travel:** How many visits will this client need? (Demo + Install + Support).
* *Calculation:* Visits × Avg Cost (e.g., 3 visits × 5,000 MMK = 15,000 MMK).


2. **Estimate Materials:** (Brochures + Contract printing = ~1,000 MMK).
3. **Base Cost:** Total Variable Cost (e.g., 16,000 MMK).
4. **Price Check:** Is the Selling Price high enough to cover the **Base Cost** + **Fixed Cost share** + **Profit**?

---

**Would you like me to generate the "Monthly Budget Tracker" Excel template with formulas to automatically calculate the Savings Target?**

Here is the **Monthly Budget Tracker** structure designed for Excel or Google Sheets. You can create three separate tabs (sheets) or put these tables on one summary dashboard.

---

### **Tab 1: Fixed Costs Log**

**Purpose:** Track recurring monthly expenses that keep the business running.

| Column Name | Column Type | Description / Dropdown Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Date Paid** | `Date` | The actual date money left the account. |
| **Category** | `Dropdown List` | Options: *Internet, Phone/Data, Transport Allowance, Utilities, Rent.* |
| **Provider/Description** | `Text` | e.g., "MMPT Fiber", "Staff Bus Fare". |
| **Amount** | `Currency` | The total amount paid. |
| **Receipt Ref** | `Text/Link` | File name of the saved receipt (e.g., `FIX_Oct_01.jpg`). |
| **Paid By** | `Text` | Name of staff member who made the payment. |

---

### **Tab 2: Variable Costs Log (Per Client)**

**Purpose:** Track specific costs related to serving a customer. Use this to spot if a client is becoming too expensive to serve.

| Column Name | Column Type | Description / Dropdown Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Date** | `Date` | Date expense occurred. |
| **Client Name** | `Text` | Must match the name in the Sales Ledger exactly. |
| **Expense Type** | `Dropdown List` | Options: *Travel (Taxi/Bus), Printing, Support Visit, Other.* |
| **Details** | `Text` | e.g., "Travel to Downtown for Install". |
| **Amount** | `Currency` | The amount spent. |
| **Receipt Ref** | `Text/Link` | File name (e.g., `VAR_Oct_05_Taxi.jpg`). |
| **Alert Check** | `Formula` | *Optional advanced check (see Formula section below).* |

---

### **Tab 3: Monthly Summary & Buffer Calculation**

**Purpose:** The "Master View" to calculate the Savings Target automatically at the end of the month.

| Metric (Row Name) | Column Type | Excel Formula / Logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **A. Total Monthly Revenue** | `Currency (Input)` | *Link to Total from Sales Ledger* (Sum of all Closed-Won deals). |
| **B. Total Fixed Costs** | `Currency (Formula)` | `=SUM(Fixed_Costs_Log!Amount_Column)` |
| **C. Total Variable Costs** | `Currency (Formula)` | `=SUM(Variable_Costs_Log!Amount_Column)` |
| **D. Total Expenses (B+C)** | `Currency (Formula)` | `=B + C` |
| **E. Net Profit (A-D)** | `Currency (Formula)` | `=A - D` |
| **F. SAVINGS TARGET (Buffer)** | `Currency (Formula)` | `=E * 20%` (This is the amount to transfer to the Reserve Account). |
| **G. Remaining Cash Flow** | `Currency (Formula)` | `=E - F` (This is the cash left for next month's operations). |

---

### **How to set up the Formulas (Copy & Paste)**

If you are building this in Excel, here are the simple formulas to use in **Tab 3**:

1. **Total Fixed Costs:** `=SUM('Tab 1'!D:D)` (Assuming Amount is in Column D)
2. **Total Variable Costs:** `=SUM('Tab 2'!E:E)` (Assuming Amount is in Column E)
3. **Savings Target (20%):** `=IF(Net_Profit > 0, Net_Profit * 0.20, 0)`
* *Note:* The `IF` statement prevents the sheet from asking you to save money if you made a loss (negative profit).



### **Visual Audit Rule**

* **Color Coding:** In the **Variable Costs Log**, highlight the "Amount" cell in **RED** if a single taxi ride exceeds a set limit (e.g., 15,000 MMK) to flag it for the Owner's review.

## **5. Logistics & Resource Management Workflow**

* **Who:** Single Staff Member (Admin & Technical Support).
* **When:**
* **Tracking:** Immediately upon every software installation or update.
* **Backups:** Every **Friday Afternoon** (Internal Data) & **During Install** (Client Data).
* **Inventory:** The **First Monday** of every month.


* **What Information:**
* **Assets:** Device Name, Serial Number, Current Condition (Good/Repair Needed), Last Maintenance Date.
* **Backups:** Date, File Name, Location (Cloud/Drive), File Size.
* **Versions:** Client Name, Current App Version (e.g., v2.1), Install Date.


* **What Format:**
* **Asset Log:** Simple Excel Sheet.
* **Version Control Log:** A dedicated column in the main "Sales & Client Ledger."
* **Storage:** External Hard Drive + Google Drive/OneDrive folder.


* **How to keep log for audit:**
* **Backups:** Take a screenshot of the folder showing the "Date Modified" and file size. Save this in the "Weekly Reports" folder.
* **Versions:** Keep a photo of the "About" screen from the client’s software after installation.


* **Who certify it:** Business Owner (Quarterly check: Restore one random file to ensure data is not corrupted).
* **How to follow up:**
* **Obsolete Versions:** If a client is >2 versions behind (e.g., v1.0 while we are on v3.0), flag them in **YELLOW** and contact them for an upgrade.
* **Hardware Failures:** Report any "Noise/Heat/Slowdown" issues with the office laptop to the Owner immediately.



### **The Process (Execution Steps)**

#### **A. Asset Management (The "Tools" List)**

*Maintain a simple list of the following critical items:*

1. **Primary Laptop:** (Used for Admin/Sales).
2. **Test Devices:** (Phone/Tablet used to demo the app).
3. **Office Printer:** (For Contracts/Invoices).
4. **External Backup Drive:** (1TB or larger, kept in a fire-safe location).

**Monthly Check:** Turn on all test devices, check battery health, and run Windows/OS updates on the laptop.

#### **B. Backup Rules (The "Safety Net")**

*Rule: 3-2-1 Simplified (2 locations: Cloud + Physical).*

**1. Internal Business Data (Fridays)**

* **What:** Sales Ledger, Finance Excel, Contract Scans.
* **Action:** Copy the entire "My Business" folder to the **External Hard Drive** AND upload to **Google Drive**.

**2. Client Data (During Install/Support)**

* **What:** Client's Database file.
* **Action:** Before touching a client's system for an update, copy their current database to a USB stick labeled "Client Backups."
* **Naming Convention:** `[ClientName]_[Date]_[PreUpdate].bak`

#### **C. Version & Release Tracking**

*Prevent support chaos by knowing exactly what the client is running.*

**1. The "Golden Record"**
In your **Client Ledger**, add two columns:

* `Current Version` (e.g., v2.5.1)
* `Last Update Date` (e.g., 12-Oct-2023)

**2. The Update Protocol**

* **Never** update a client without logging it first.
* After the update, change the `Current Version` in the ledger immediately.

---

**Would you like me to create the "Asset & Version Master Log" template (Excel/Table) to track these details?**



Here is the structure for the **Asset & Version Master Log**, designed to be set up as three separate tabs in an Excel or Google Sheets file.

---

### **Tab 1: Company Asset Inventory**

**Purpose:** Track the physical tools you own to ensure nothing gets lost or broken without notice.

| Column Name | Column Type | Description / Dropdown Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Asset ID** | `Text` | Unique label (e.g., `LAP-01`, `TAB-02`, `HDD-01`). |
| **Item Name** | `Text` | e.g., "Main Admin Laptop", "Samsung Test Tablet". |
| **Serial Number** | `Text (Alphanumeric)` | The manufacturer's S/N (found on the back or in settings). |
| **Purchase Date** | `Date` | When it was bought (for warranty tracking). |
| **Current Condition** | `Dropdown List` | Options: *Excellent, Good, Needs Maintenance, Broken/Retired.* |
| **Last Maintenance** | `Date` | Date of last software cleanup or physical check. |
| **Storage Location** | `Text` | Where it stays when not in use (e.g., "Office Safe"). |

---

### **Tab 2: Backup Activity Log**

**Purpose:** An audit trail to prove that data is safe. If a crash happens, look here to find the latest file.

| Column Name | Column Type | Description / Dropdown Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Backup Date** | `Date` | The exact date the backup was performed. |
| **Backup Type** | `Dropdown List` | Options: *Internal Business Data, Client Pre-Install, Client Database.* |
| **Related Client** | `Text` | If "Client" type, enter Client Name. If "Internal", enter "N/A". |
| **Destination** | `Dropdown List` | Options: *External Hard Drive (HDD), Google Drive, USB Stick.* |
| **File Name** | `Text` | Exact name of the saved file (e.g., `Backup_Oct23.zip`). |
| **File Size** | `Text/Number` | e.g., "2.5 GB" (Helps confirm the file isn't empty). |
| **Verified By** | `Text` | Initials of the staff member who checked the file exists. |

---

### **Tab 3: Client Version Control Master**

**Purpose:** The most critical table for support. It tells you exactly what software version a client is running so you don't waste time diagnosing fixed bugs.

| Column Name | Column Type | Description / Dropdown Options |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Client Name** | `Text` | Must match the Sales Ledger exactly. |
| **License Key** | `Text` | The unique activation code given to this client. |
| **Current App Version** | `Text` | e.g., `v1.0`, `v2.5`, `v3.0.1`. |
| **Initial Install Date** | `Date` | When they first started using the system. |
| **Last Update Date** | `Date` | The last time we visited/remoted in to upgrade them. |
| **OS / Environment** | `Text` | Details about their hardware (e.g., "Windows 10, 8GB RAM"). |
| **Update Status** | `Formula / Dropdown` | Options: *Current, Outdated (1 Version), Critical Upgrade Needed.* |

---

### **💡 Pro-Tip: Visual Alerts (Conditional Formatting)**

* **In Tab 1 (Assets):** Set the "Current Condition" column to turn **RED** if "Needs Maintenance" is selected.
* **In Tab 3 (Versions):** Create a rule for the "Current App Version" column. If the text does not match the latest release (e.g., "v3.0"), highlight the cell in **YELLOW**. This creates an instant "Sales Opportunity" list to call clients for upgrades.

 **6. HR & Growth Management Workflow**

* **Who:** Business Owner (Strategic Decision Maker).
* **When:**
* **Review:** Quarterly (Jan, April, July, Oct).
* **Action:** Triggered strictly when specific "Workload Thresholds" are crossed.


* **What Information:**
* **Workload Metrics:** Average hours spent on Support vs. Sales vs. Admin.
* **Financial Health:** Consistent monthly revenue vs. Estimated cost of new hire.
* **Performance Gaps:** "Missed Calls" count or "Late Support Replies" count.


* **What Format:** "Growth Trigger Checklist" (A simple Yes/No strategic document).
* **How to keep log for audit:** Save the Quarterly Review notes in a "Strategy" folder. Document the decision: *"Not hiring yet because revenue is below X"* or *"Initiating search for Freelancer."*
* **Who certify it:** Business Owner.
* **How to follow up:**
* **If Triggered:** Draft a Job Description (JD) within 48 hours.
* **If Not Triggered:** Re-evaluate in 3 months. **Do not** hire based on "feeling busy"—hire based on data.



### **The Process (Roles, Triggers & Payment Models)**

#### **A. Role: Marketing Helper (Content & Ads)**

* *Why:* To keep leads flowing when the Staff Member is too busy closing deals.
* **Trigger Rule:**
1. Leads drop below 5 per week for 2 consecutive months.
2. **OR** Current Staff is too busy to post 2x/week (as per Marketing SOP).


* **Payment Model:** **Per Project / Asset.**
* *Example:* Pay $X per 5 videos or $Y per set of graphics. No fixed monthly salary.



#### **B. Role: Technical Assistant / Developer Helper**

* *Why:* To handle installation and bugs so the main Staff can focus on selling.
* **Trigger Rule:**
1. **>10 Active Clients** requiring support.
2. **OR** Support Ticket resolution time exceeds 24 hours more than 3 times a month.


* **Payment Model:** **Part-Time / Hourly.**
* *Example:* Retainer for 10 hours/month. If they work more, pay hourly overtime.



#### **C. Role: Sales Consultant / Agent**

* *Why:* To penetrate a new specific market (e.g., a new city or specific industry).
* **Trigger Rule:**
1. Business has "Cash Buffer" (from Budget SOP) equal to 3 months of expenses.
2. **AND** You want to expand to a location you cannot physically visit.


* **Payment Model:** **100% Commission-Based.**
* *Example:* Higher commission rate (e.g., 20-30%) but **Zero Base Salary**. Risk is on them; reward is high.



---

### **3-Step Hiring Protocol**

*Follow this strictly to prevent bad hires.*

1. **The Test Task:** Never hire on interview alone. Give a small, paid task first (e.g., *"Fix this one bug"* or *"Design one post"*).
2. **The Probation:** All new roles start with a 1-month "Probation Contract" with a 3-day notice period.
3. **The Access Rule:** Never give a new hire full admin access immediately. Use "Guest" or "Editor" permissions until month 3.

## **7. Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E) Workflow**

* **Who:** Business Owner (Reviewer) & Single Staff Member (Data Reporter).
* **When:**
* **Data Collection:** Last Friday of the month.
* **Review Meeting:** First Monday of the new month (30-minute deep dive).


* **What Information:**
* **Funnel Metrics:** Total Leads  Total Demos  Total Installs.
* **Financial Metrics:** Total Revenue vs. Fixed/Variable Costs (Profit Margin).
* **Health Metrics:** Number of open support tickets, Number of overdue payments.


* **What Format:** "Monthly Business Health Dashboard" (One-page summary sheet).
* **How to keep log for audit:** Save the dashboard as PDF in a folder named `Year_M&E_Reports`. Compare the current month against the previous month (Month-over-Month growth).
* **Who certify it:** Business Owner.
* **How to follow up:**
* **If Green (On Target):** Approve the budget for next month.
* **If Red (Warning):** Freeze non-essential spending and activate the "Early Warning Actions" (see below).



### **The Process (Business Targets)**

#### **A. Monthly Performance Targets (The "Pulse")**

*The Staff Member fills this data from the Sales & Finance Ledgers.*

| Metric | Target (Example) | Actual | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **New Leads** | 10 per month |  | [ ] |
